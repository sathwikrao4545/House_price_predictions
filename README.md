Real Estate Price Prediction Analysis
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict real estate prices based on key features like crime rates, average room sizes, proximity to amenities, and more. The analysis is performed using the Boston Housing Dataset.

Project Overview
Problem Statement
Real estate price predictions are often influenced by various economic, social, and geographical factors, leading to inconsistent forecasting. This project aims to address this challenge using machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.

Solution
By leveraging the Boston Housing Dataset and analyzing it with multiple machine learning models, we identify the most influential features and the best-performing models for price prediction.

Key Findings
Ensemble models, particularly Random Forest, outperform simpler models like Linear Regression and Decision Trees.
Data cleaning and feature engineering play a critical role in improving model performance.
